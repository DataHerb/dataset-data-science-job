The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. With the ever-accelerating technological advances and growing system complexity, NSA needs Hardware/Software Design Engineers to design, develop, construct and test electronic hardware and software processing components. These components are typically subsystems of communication, collection, processing or analysis systems. Hardware/Software Design Engineers are hired into positions supporting a broad range of specialized skills including Computer Engineering, Computer Programming, Computer Software Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Communications Engineering. Positions may be an office directly supporting a technical mission or one of three Development Programs: the Resident Signals Engineering Program (RSE), System Engineer Development Program (SEDP) or the Information Technology Development Program (ITDP). The Resident Signals Engineering Program is a 4-year technical development program focused on the collection, processing, and analysis of signals in any environment and in any media. The RSE Program offers selected technical personnel unique opportunities for self-directed diversity tours in core mission areas where they will learn about, and provide solutions for, many of the toughest technical problems facing the Agency. The SEDP prepares recent college graduates (engineering-related degrees) for a career in systems engineering at NSA. Applying systems engineering tradecraft and building a network while working with leading NSA experts prepares SEDP engineers for advanced or leadership assignments. The SEDP covers the breadth of systems engineering core competencies, including technical/analytical, technical management, and organizational/business processes. During the three-year full-time program, SEDP engineers rotate assignments to gain exposure to various NSA mission areas, attend systems engineering training and visits throughout the IC, and earn DoD DAWIA and other important credentials. The ITDP is a three-year full-time development program designed to provide entry-level information technology specialists (that is, individuals with degrees in computer science, engineering, computer security, information systems, information technology, and related degrees and experience) the opportunity to acquire the skills and technical capabilities necessary to successfully execute NSA's mission. In this program, participants gain a depth of knowledge in a breadth of information technology disciplines, including system/security, software engineering, software project management, and system architecture. ITDP participants work in teams and with NSA technical leaders to solve current and future challenging IT problems. The responsibilities of a Hardware/Software Design Engineer may include: - Designing, developing, testing, and/or evaluating computer or computer-related equipment. - Programming, modifying and/or configuring system software that manages the computer hardware and provides services to the applications. - Applying software engineering principles to design, develop, test, and evaluate/modify software applications.</p><br /><p><strong>Job Summary</strong></p><br /><p>As an Engineering and Physical Science professional, you will use your skills to create the systems and tools that will be used to enhance the operation of intelligence. You will advise, administer and perform scientific projects, such as planning, designing, and constructing specialized equipment, and ensuring adherence to sound engineering and scientific standards and principles.

The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive of classified national security information. Signals Analysis is a technical discipline that seeks to identify the purpose, content and user(s) of signals. Given today's rapidly evolving global communication, the NSA must maintain and develop a highly talented and diverse workforce of Signals Analysts who are a vital part in maintaining our technical capabilities to use the most sophisticated means to recover, understand, exploit and derive intelligence from all manner of foreign signals. Description of the Job Telemetry and Signals Analysts are hired into positions directly supporting a technical mission office. The work done by our Analysts is of the utmost importance to National Security and the defense of our Nation. Only the most skilled and dedicated are able to join our team. If you have what it takes please apply and be part of the agency that is on the front line of Modern Warfare. Telemetry use in the defense industry includes spacecraft monitoring, aircraft development, and weapons system testing. Telemetry is used by manned and unmanned spacecraft for various data transmissions including monitoring the health of astronauts as well as the health and status of the actual spacecraft. Telemetry for weapons testing includes monitoring temperatures, vibrations, accelerations, positions and status of various subsystems. Telemetry is also used for range safety related to flight testing to determine flight termination criteria. The role of a telemetry analyst is to reverse engineer the data transmitted by various systems to determine the performance characteristics and capabilities of these systems. Signals Analysts supporting a technical mission office analyze signals from various sources, including foreign communications, radar and other electronic systems. The selected individual will work in a dynamic environment with duties that can include the following: - Identify and analyze waveforms in different domains (e.g., weapon systems, communications systems) - Identify and analyze bitstreams (e.g., multiplexers, error correction, voice and video compression, instrumentation systems) - Identify and analyze protocols (e.g., link layer, network layer, application layer) The ideal candidate is someone with a desire for continual learning and strong problem-solving, analytic and interpersonal skills who is/can - accountable - flexible - resilient - communicate effectively - collaborate with others Specialized skills and experience in one or more of the following is desired: - applying specialized tools and computer-based programs to process data for analytic problems - assessing applicability of available tools to various situations - combining analytics, tools, and visualization to support analysis - interpreting output of specialized tools and computer-based programs - programming / script development - weapon system design or testing - telemetry system design or implementation</p><br /><br /><br /><p><strong>Job Summary</strong></p><br /><p>Signals Analysis is a cutting-edge technical discipline that seeks to identify the purpose, content and user(s) of signals.
